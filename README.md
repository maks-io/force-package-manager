# force-package-manager ðŸš”ðŸ“¦

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/force-package-manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/force-package-manager)

**npm** | **yarn-classic** | **yarn-berry** | **pnpm** | **bun**
... never mix package managers again!

A Command Line Tool to avoid that different team members use different package managers by accident, and therefor mess up your repository.

_Note: this tool clearly distinguishes between yarn version 1 ('classic') vs. yarn version 2+ ('berry')._

## Usage

Just add a `preinstall` script to your `package.json` file, like so:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx -l -y force-package-manager -p npm"
  }
}
```

A more detailed example with some options:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx -l -y force-package-manager -p npm -r '7.x.x' -o mute"
  }
}
```

This variant additionally restricts the version range for `npm` to `7.x.x` and only prints minimal output, due to `-o mute`.

## How does it work

### Quick summary

The script works in 3 steps:

1. Tries to find the wanted package manager
2. Tries to find the currently running package manager
3. Compares them

### Detailed

Let us look at more details about the individual steps:

1. Tries to find the wanted package manager
   1. Checks if the wanted package manager is defined via the `-p` / `--pmname` option
   2. If not, it checks if the package manager is defined via the `packageManager` property in the `package.json` file. This is done with the [identify-package-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/identify-package-manager) package.
   3. If not, it checks if the project has already been installed and therefore a lockfile, which can tell us the wanted package manager as well. This is also done with the [identify-package-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/identify-package-manager) package.
2. Tries to find the currently running package manager
   1. This is done with the [which-pm-runs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/which-pm-runs) package.
3. Compares them
   1. First it compares if the package manager itself matches
   2. If yes, it also checks if the desired version range is satisfied (via the [semver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) package).
